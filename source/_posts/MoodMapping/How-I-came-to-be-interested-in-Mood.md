> As with so many people in life, who research specific topics, their interest comes from personal experience

就如许多人在生活中一样，他们研究特定的主题，他们的兴趣来源于他们的个人经历。

> I qualified as a medical doctor in 1980, just before my 23rd birthday. I had raced through A’levels, med school, and the age of 25 was only the third woman to practice as a neurosurgeon in the UK. At the time, British neurosurgeons prided themselves as the last bastion of male supremacy, firmly holding the line against appointing women trainees. No pressure!

我在1980年正式成为一名医学博士，那时正好是我23岁生日。我已经完成了A级考试和医学院的学习，并在25岁时，成为英国第三个从事神经外科手术的女性。当时，英国神经外科医生为自己是男性至上的最后堡垒而自豪，坚决反对任命女性实习生。这下压力来了！

> By the time I was 28, I had published a dozen research papers, and was on my way to be the first woman appointed in neurosurgery since the 1950s. It was not to be, I developed bipolar disorder and crashed ingloriously out of neurosurgery and any chance of a career in medicine – such was the stigma and prejudice surrounding mental health problems.

在我28岁时，我已经发表了十几篇研究论文，并即将成为自1950年代以来第一位被任命为神经外科医生的女性。但事与愿违，我患上了躁郁症，并不光彩地退出了神经外科和任何医学职业的机会——这就是围绕心理健康问题的耻辱和偏见。

> After two further episodes, spending more than a year in various hospitals, three mental health sections and having wasted my thirties trying to stay well enough to work, I finally admitted to myself that maybe I had to deal with my problems.

经过两次进一步的发作，在不同的医院花了一年多的时间，在三个精神健康部门，并浪费了我三十多岁的时间来保持足够的健康来工作，我终于对自己承认，也许我必须处理我的问题。

>  practice as ...：从事某职业
>  No pressure：本意为“没压力”，但在俚语里，它带有讽刺性的语气，意思是“这下压力来了”
