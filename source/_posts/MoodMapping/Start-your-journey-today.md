> Understanding how you feel and how your mood impacts your health and wellbeing is an essential life skill. It is a skill as basic as driving.  It is the start of self-knowledge It begins with understanding how you feel, and why you feel that way. MoodMapping is a way to navigate through life’s ups and downs and feel in charge rather than buffeted by every change in wind and fortune..

> Not everyone reads books, and the intention of this website is to help you get some to grips with this essential life skill at your own pace. Self- knowledge helps you build better relationships, first with yourself, then with the people around you and once you are in a better place find your soulmate, your teammates, and the community that best reflects your own beliefs and values.

心境地图是免费的，每个人都可以绘制心境地图，并用它来帮助改善自己和周围人的健康和幸福。

> It is easy to learn to map your mood. It is visual, rather than verbal and is accessible to everyone. I have families who have a mood map on their fridge. Every morning, each family member marks where they are on the map. The family aim to have everyone feeling positive and on the right side of the map, by the end of the day, regardless of where they started.

你能轻松学会如何绘制你的情绪。它是可视的，而不是口头的，每个人都可以看到它。我的家人们把他们的心境地图贴在了冰箱上，每日早晨，每人都会在心境地图上标出自己的位置。这个家庭目标是让每个人在一天结束时都感到积极和正确，不管他们从哪里开始。
